# Abstract
This study addresses the critical challenges in the 3D reconstruction of traffic signs for improved inspection and maintenance. Current practices in traffic sign detection, recognition, and localisation are reviewed, highlighting significant research gaps and limitations. We propose a novel approach leveraging mobile mapping data and image-based inspection to enhance the fidelity and detail of 3D traffic sign models for maintenance decision-making. The methodology involves a two-step semi-automated process: initially reducing manual workload during data preparation and performing 3D reconstruction based on extracted features. Our proposed solution integrates with Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) for seamless BIM workflows, providing a robust data model for traffic sign maintenance. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating detailed, low-polygon models suitable for real-time updates, thus offering a promising direction for future research in procedural mesh generation and automated defect detection.
